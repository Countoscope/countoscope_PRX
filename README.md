# Use
To use
```py
import countoscope as countoscope

results = countoscope.calculate_nmsd(data=f"data.dat", window_size_x=217.6, window_size_y=174, box_sizes=Box_Ls, sep_sizes=sep)
```
See the full example in `example_runcounting.py` (which also includes plotting)

The parameters to `calculate_nmsd` are:
* `data`. Either:
  * `data` should be a string, the address of a text file containing rows of x, y, t values, whitespace separated. 
  * or `data` should be provided as a 2D array where `data[i, 0:2]` is `[x, y, t]`
  * the `t` values should be the index of the frame. They can be 0-based or 1-based (or any other), and can be supplied as floats or integers.
* `window_size_x` and `window_size_y` optional, the dimensions of the viewing window. If not supplied, the maximum x and y coordinate over all frames and particles will be used instead.
  * it is assumed that the particles lie in `0 <= x <= window_size_x` and `0 <= y <= window_size_y`. Viewing windows not cornered at the origin are not currently supported.
* The box sizes are specified as:
  * if only `box_sizes` is provided, the boxes will be square, width and height of box `i` equal to `box_sizes[i]`.
  * if `box_sizes_x` and `box_sizes_y` are provided, box `i` will be of shape `box_sizes_x[i]` * `box_sizes_y[i]`.
  * however, if you want one of the width or height to be constant, you can just pass a single value to one of `box_sizes_x` or `box_sizes_y` and then all boxes will have the same width or height.
* `sep_sizes` should be an array of the same size as `box_sizes`/`box_sizes_x`/`box_sizes_y`
  * if any elements of `sep_sizes` are negative, the boxes will overlap. This causes the library to use a different algorithm to count the particles which is substantially slower. You should be careful when choosing the overlaps; if the overlap is a rational fraction of the box size then some boxes' edges will touch, leaving the counts correlated.

# Dependencies
numpy, scipy, and numba. By default, numba will run using as many threads as you have cores on your machine. Use `NUMBA_NUM_THREADS=16 python ....` to limit numba to a certain number of threads if you don't want it to use all your cores. If `tqdm` is installed, we will use it for nice progress bars.

# Debugging
If you get an annoying C error like `Segmentation fault`, try running with `NUMBA_DISABLE_JIT=1 python myscript.py` to disable numba compilation (it will take much longer), and see if you get any pure Python errors
